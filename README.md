## Frameworks
* **OpenNRE** [[github]](https://github.com/thunlp/OpenNRE) [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3029.pdf)
    * Is an open-source and extensible toolkit that provides a unified framework to implement neural models for relation extraction (RE) between named entities. 
    It is designed for various scenarios for RE, including sentence-level RE, bag-level RE, document-level RE, and few-shot RE. 
    It provides various functional RE modules based on both TensorFlow and PyTorch to maintain sufficient modularity and extensibility, making it becomes easy to incorporate new models into the framework.
* **AREkit** [[github]](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit) [[research-applicable-paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13730.pdf)
    * Is an open-source and extensible toolkit focused on data preparation for document-level relation extraction organization. 
    It complements the OpenNRE functionality, as in terms of the latter, *document-level RE setting is not widely explored* (2.4 [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D19-3029.pdf)).
    The core functionality includes 
    (1) API for document presentation with EL (Entity Linking, i.e. Object Synonymy) support 
    for sentence level relations preparation (dubbed as contexts)
    (2) API for contexts extraction
    (3) relations transferring from sentence-level onto document-level, etc.
    It provides 
    [neural networks](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit/tree/0.21.0-rc/contrib/networks) (like OpenNRE)
    and
    [BERT](https://github.com/nicolay-r/AREkit/tree/0.21.0-rc/contrib/bert) modules,
    both applicable for sentiment attitude extraction task.
* **DeRE** [[github]](https://github.com/ims-tcl/DeRE) [[paper]](https://aclanthology.org/D18-2008/)
	* Is an open-source framework for **de**claritive **r**elation **e**xtraction, and therefore allows to declare your own task (using XML schemas) and apply manually implemented models towards it (using a provided API).
	The task declaration builds on top of the *spans* and *relations between spans*. In terms of the latter, authors propose *frames*, where every frame yelds of: (1) *trigger* (span) and (2) *n*-slots, where every slot
	may refer to *frame* or *span*. 
	The framework poses no theoretical restrictions to the window from which frames are extracted.
	Thus, this concept may cover sentence-level, document-level and multi-document RE tasks.
